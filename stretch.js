// Research the differences between functional programming and object oriented programming. Then, describe the pros and cons of functional programming vs object-oriented programming. This is a common interview question and great practice!

/*Functional programming involves using functions to handle data and the output of the functions is known. Object-oriented programming uses objects and object methods to handle or change data. When dealing with relatively simple data with pre-defined boundaries for output, functional programming is usually more effective. A good example of this is front-end development - usually we recieve some data in the form of an API call for example, then simply need to output that data on the page. OOP is good for dealing with complex data, for example a back-end server that needs to process some data to prepare it for an API query.

Functional programming will not be effective at handling large amounts of complex data. Similarly, OOP would be overkill in many situations where the data is simple and complex data storage/processing is not required.
